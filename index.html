		<h2>Chess Enthusiast</h2>

		<p>Hello and welcome to my website. This website is out to showcase my web coding skills, but at the same time, to show my passion about chess.</p>

		I love playing chess, and have won a major tournament on a lower bracket. I definitly do believe that, chess helps in improving an individual's cognitive skills. <a href="https://drgsbrainworks.com/2015/01/10-ways-chess-builds-your-brain/" target="_blank"> Click here </a> to go to the website that describes the benefits of chess.
